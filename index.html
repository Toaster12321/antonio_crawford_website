        Hi! My name is Antonio Crawford and I am a graduated student who attended <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">CSUSB</a> with a degree in Computer Science. I first became interested in studying computer science when I took a high school AP Computer Science course focusing on the Java programming language. As a long standing player and programmer my main goal is to pursue my interest and passion in video game development, design and programming.
